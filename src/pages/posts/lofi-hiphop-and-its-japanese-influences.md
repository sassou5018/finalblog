I think it’s fair to assume you came across this young girl somewhere on the internet whether it was on Facebook, Instagram or Youtube. If you haven’t, this is the signature of an up and coming genre of music called lo-fi hip hop.



This new phenomena consists of imperfect, mostly amateur made music that sounds warm and chill. The fuzzy sounds and the audible static in these songs coupled with their mellow and somewhat familiar beats make a very relaxing and inexplicably relatable sound.



Now Lo-fi music is in no way a new genre, it has been around for a while. Made popular by American Rock band The Beach Boys and the late singer-songwriter Daniel Johnston the genre evolved but it didn’t stray away from it’s rock origins with artists such as Ariel Pink,rapper MF Doom and Neutral Milk Hotel, the last being the most popular amongst the pioneers of this genre with their legendary album In The Aeroplane Over The Sea.

The DIY spirit of Lo-fi and its indie nature persisted and mixed with the ease of access and the internet and after being influenced by artists such as Nujabes a new genre was born: Lo-fi hip hop.



Jun Seba or most known as Nujabes ,a Japanese musician and the man behind the Samurai Champloo soundtrack, was hip hop pioneer recognized far beyond Japan. Jun’s atmospheric hip hop music shared a lot of traits with lo-fi productions, such as atmospheric sounds and mellow beats, and it paved  the way for the rise of the Lo-fi hip hop genre. The similarities are quite apparent in songs such as “Shiki No Uta” which is Samurai champloo’s ending credits song or in “Aruarian Dance.”

Being closely related to Japanese hip hop and otaku culture, Lo-fi hip hop started gaining attention in late 2017 with a non stop Youtube live stream called “Lofi Hip Hop Radio 24/7 Chill Gaming / Study Beats” hosted by the popular Chillhop Records channel.



The original Radio stream by the Chillhop group being the one that attracted the most attention was shut down in 2018 due to a copyright claim by anime house Studio Shizu for the use of a 5 second long looped clip of Yuki from the animated movie Wolf Children.

The iconic clip became synonymous with the genre and the “Ghibliesque” anime aesthetic persisted and evolved with the genre.



Nowadays the most popular Lo-fi hip hop radio is streamed by ChilledCow, a Youtube channel that streams the genre 24/7. The copyrighted clip of Yuki studying got replaced by a specially made clip by artist [Juan Pablo Machado](http://jpmachado.art/en/portfolio).



ChilledCow’s live stream itself was briefly taken down around the 24th of February, 2020 after a copyright claim. The radio is up and running again but the over 500 hours long live stream was interrupted.

The decor, the endless studying for an exam that never comes and the art style are all reminiscent of anime culture and the way some older melancholic and pessimistic 90s shows representations of Japanese student life the likes of Neon Genesis Evangelion and Great Teacher Onizuka.



The genre’s Japanese influences don’t stop there. At any given time of the day there’s an 80% chance of finding a song with a Japanese title, Japanese lyrics or Japanese adlibs being streamed on ChilledCow’s radio.



In conclusion it seems the spread of Japanese culture influenced this contemporary music genre of relaxing background music to such levels that it’s played even in Tunisian coffee shops. The genre is worth a try if you’re looking for background music to study or to relax to. Even though some critics consider it a bit boring and shallow background noise.
