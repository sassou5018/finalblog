Though the Japanese culture is seen as exotic and borderline bizarre, Takashi Murakami believed the more recent Japanese artistic and cultural movements were nothing but mere appropriations of the West.



But who is Takashi Murakami?



Takashi, born on February 1st, 1962 is a Japanese contemporary artist who pioneered a new artistic movement called superflat, a combination of the traditional Japanese culture and the more modern post world war westernised Japanese lifestyle.

The artist grew up as an anime and manga fan and aspired to become an animator himself, that’s why he attended the Tokyo University Of the Arts, though he ended up majoring in Nihonga, the art of traditional Japanese painting.



Maybe Takashi is most known for his collaboration with influential hip hop artist Kanye West on the album art for “Kids See Ghosts,” West’s collab project with fellow hip hop GOAT Kid Cudi. Takashi’s collabs with Kanye go farther back than the 2018 album. Back in 2007, Takashi provided the artwork for Ye’s album “Graduation” and even directed the music video for the song “Good Morning.”

Takashi has also worked with Pharrell Williams on a collaborative sculpture back in 2009. In 2002 he was invited by Marc Jacobs to begin his long-lasting collaboration with the fashion brand Louis Vuitton for which he helped design a series of handbags and even helped reinvent the brand’s monogram.

The contemporary artist has dabbled a bit in feature film animation too, directing his first movie in 2013 titled Jellyfish eyes (Mememe no Kurage).



Even though it is mostly satirical and critical of the modern Japanese lifestyle, Takashi’s work combining ancient traditional Japanese styles with contemporary westernised styles and his collaborations with commercial brands and hip hop artists are changing the Japanese art scene and are blurring the lines between high avant-garde art and low consumer friendly art.
