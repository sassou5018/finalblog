Due to never being published in the west many Japanese gems are lost and very hard to come by.

Full discographies are left to collect dust on old Japanese corner stores and record shops, never popping up on spotify or the likes except for some that make it through the medium of Youtube and the bizarre works of its algorithms.



Not unlike Mariya Takeuchi’s Plastic Love and Junko Ohashi’s Telephone Number, some of these gems show up on people’s Youtube recommendations or are discovered by pure luck.



Some of the less obscure J-rock bands are PenPals and Silver Fins even though full Albums and EPs of theirs are very hard to come by and information about their older work is very scarce on the internet even after they were featured on the 1997 animated adaptation of Berserk.



**Exposure through the Berserk anime:**

First let’s talk about PenPals, the band known for their work on Berserk’s 1997 energetic yet mellow opening song.

“Tell Me Why” isn’t only the title of the song, it is also the name of their 1997 EP.

Although the punk rock band reunited in 2011 and released a new album titled Past rest summer they are still pretty obscure in the west and their music is very hard to find on the internet (especially their older works).

Now to Silver Fins the band behind Berserk’s credit music.

Formed around the same time as PenPals by Hitomi Takenaka & Mitsuhiro Asakura, members from a previous band called Salon Music, the band has almost no online presence and as far as I can tell have a single EP titled “Waiting So Long”.

The psychedelic indie rock band has a very distinct sound with vocals akin to that of the american indie rock band Pavement, the similarities are at an extreme in Silver Fins’ Waiting So Long and Pavement’s AT&T.

Although Silver Fins is hard to find on the internet their old band Salon Music is very popular in and outside of Japan with The JapanTimes saying they’re “way ahead of the curve”.

**A Youtube search typo:**

A few years back while looking for full versions of PenPals’ and Silver Fins’ EPs with a friend a typo led us to an indie J-pop band called Advantage Lucy.

Thanks to the typo we discovered a staple of Japanese indie pop, a band formed in 1995 under the name Lucy Van Pelt after the peanuts character of the same name which then changed to Advantage Lucy due to a lawsuit threat by the peanuts copyright holders.

The less obscure in Japan band’s sound is inspired by 60s Jangle pop, The Smiths and according to Last FM “Anything else that makes people feel good”.

The death of Fukumura one of the founding members from heart trouble at age 29 marked a temporary end to the band all the way back in 2001 although Solaris, their newly formed record label continued to release LPs.

In 2004 the core duo of Ishizaka and Aiko and supporting musicians revived the group for a live performance in Korea which led to the release of 2 new EPs in 2005.

Advantage Lucy although not very popular outside eastern Asia are still active and still have their fair share of fans in Japan, Korea and Taiwan.



Have a good journey is one of the band’s best and most popular releases being a best of compilation from April 2001 a few months before the departure of Fukumara.

**Youtube Algorithm gem:**

Being subscribed to the only channel on Youtube that uploads some of these obscure Japanese albums and EPs, I came across a small EP by a more modern and less obscure J-rock / Post punk / Emo duo called Lucky Old Sun.

The band’s name is an ode to Beasley Smith’s 1949 american hit “That lucky old sun”.

Formed in 2013 by the couple Nana and her husband Yoshiaki Shinohara the band first popped up on Tumblr with the handle “Luckyoldsun2013”.

Their first work was a mini album titled “I’m so sorry,mom”. Nana’s young heartwarming vocals and the slow yet energetic backing instruments make the short EP a very enjoyable listen.

Being newer than some of the other bands Lucky Old Sun are present on Twitter, Tumblr and Soundcloud with 2 full albums, multiple EPs/mini albums and a 3rd full album on the way.

**Solidcake the J-rock genie:**

Solidcake is the Youtube handle of a channel that specialises in uploading and hoarding very obscure Japanese albums and EPs alongside many Anime OSTs.

All the albums i linked in this article can almost only be found on Solidcake’s channel. Even Lucky Old Sun’s EP sounds cleaner on the small Youtube channel than the release on the band’s official soundcloud profile.

Other than Youtube some very rare and sometimes expensive physical copies of the albums are available on Amazon for import from Japan.
