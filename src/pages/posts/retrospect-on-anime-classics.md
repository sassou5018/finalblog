Few anime feature films have achieved classic status with all of the competition against long running anime series the likes of Naruto Shippuden, Bleach, One Piece and others, but the phrase “classic anime movies” brings certain pictures to mind.



If you look closely you’ll notice that a huge number of what are considered classics nowadays are animated movies from the late 90s, a nostalgic period for some and a time of more creative freedom and experimentations for others. A lot of titles come to mind when you mention the 90s, but some of the more interesting ones are:



**Perfect Blue**, a 1998 animated Japanese thriller. A movie praised globally by critics and viewers alike for it’s takes on psychology and relevant social issues in Japan and the entire world.

In short Perfect Blue follows Mima Kirigoe an ex-idol turned actress as she descends into a state of madness due to her ending up as a victim of stalking. The movie moves away from the cheerful anime stereotype and dives into the absurd focusing on the gradual blurring of the line between reality and fantasy in the character’s descent into delusion.

Perfect Blue doesn’t shy away from blood, gruesome murder, psychological and mental illness and treads around the borderline insane as opposed to the seemingly tame nature of animated movies. This allowed Perfect Blue to be a marvelously terrifying and harrowing experience and a must watch classic that remains relevant to this day.

**Ghost in the Shell** another classic released in the same era. The 1995 movie by Mamoru Oshii, that got a live action adaptation recently and is getting a spin off show on netflix very soon, is another movie that doesn’t avoid talking about controversial and taboo subjects.

The Cyberpunk movie focuses on a cybernetically enhanced security agent and the hunt of a mysterious hacker involved in multiple high profile crimes and political assassinations and who’s an international security threat. 

Although the movie was praised for its advanced visuals at the time, it still presented a riveting story that explored ethical, philosophical themes like self identity and humanity’s fate in a technology reliant world. The focal point of the movie is the character’s loss of her sense of self after being subject to multiple cybernetic augmentations and alterations to her body but the movie does bring up other issues like the complexity and sinister reality of politics and the consequences of the over enhancement of the human brain and body.

Ghost in the shell went on to be one of the big inspirations of the Wachowski brothers the creators of The Matrix.

**Akira**, although older than some of the other titles here it shares many of their properties especially the undeniable relevance it still has today.

The 1988 movie went on to inspire not only other writers, mangakas and animators but went on to influence musicians the likes Kanye West.

The rapper even went on to claim that Akira was “The greatest animation achievement in history”.

Maybe the most iconic thing from akira is the legendary bike scene.

A memorable scene that went to spin off a chain of references and recreations in hundreds of other artistic works such as these:

The post apocalyptique cyberpunk masterpiece set in 2019 neo-tokyo follows Shōtarō Kaneda the leader of a local biker gang in his quest to save his childhood friend Tetsuo Shima.

The movie takes place in a deeply corrupt rebuilt version of Tokyo. Protests, terrorism, violence and chaos plague the streets and the city is on the verge of collapse. The movie’s gradual descent into more and more absurd and bizarre territory is perfectly executed and makes it a still relevant classic to this day.

The ongoing fight between the rival gangs, the corrupt parliament and the military complex, the violence and the protests and the impending doom that is approaching the city set up for a riveting experience that will probably change your life.



**The End of Evangelion** is an alternative ending to Neon Genesis Evangelion that picks up from episode 24.

Hideki Anno’s controversial masterpiece has been voted as one of the best 100 anime movies of all time by Time Out magazine and other filmmakers.

The fan theories about this timeless piece are never ending as it’s plot is one of the most absurd and most open ended plots seen in a popular movie spawning a never ending stream of interpretations. The continuation of Shinji’s storyline starting from episode 24 from the anime leads to one of the most iconic scenes in film history.

An ending that is still moving, disturbing and extremely complexe accompanied by the iconic Komm Susser Tod soundtrack. 

The movie explores Shinji’s personality, the burden of the responsibility set on his shoulders, other character’s expectations, Shinji’s complicated relationship with his father, his mother’s absence, the traumatic experience he lives as an Eva pilot, the complexity of his father’s bizarre apocalyptic conspiracy and unending trauma caused by other surprises culminates in an extremely interesting story about depression, about family, about the psychology of adolescence and about life in general.

Neon Genesis Evangelion, The End of Evangelion, and the 3 Evangelion remakes are all remarkable feats of art each.



The one thing all of these works of art share other than them being produced in the same time period is their bold takes on philosophical and societal matters and the amount of creativity they show. The 90s was a period where writers, directors and studios had more creative freedom and cared more about the integrity of their artistic work than its monetization, allowing them to dive deeper into more absurd and sometimes incomprehensible plots for the viewer to reflect and expand upon in their own time. The initial failure of some of those experimental works is what pushed big studios away from such movies even though some of the absurdity and experimentation seems to have seeped through to some 2000s movies such as the Studio Ghibli films like Spirited Away, The cat returns, Howl’s Moving Castle and Ponyo On The Cliff.
